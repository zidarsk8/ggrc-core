  <h3>Quick import tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>not all fields are required!</strong> Templates are fexible enough, so you can remove all non-mandatory columns (refer to row 4 to see which fields are required)</li>
    <li>you can <strong>map</strong> objects via import. Simply add <strong>map:control</strong> column and use object codes in the column to map objects. You can <strong>unmap</strong> objects in the same way</li>
    <li>you can <strong>delete</strong> objects in the similar way. Add <strong>delete</strong> column in line 5 and put <em>yes</em> in rows for objects you want to delete</li>
    <li>If objects already exist fields <strong>you leave empty</strong> will be ignored. (Object's attributes will not be replaced with empty info)</li>
    <li>For extensive import help, refer to <a href="#">Import Help/FAQ</a> section below</li>
