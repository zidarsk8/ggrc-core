"""Import all squashed migrations from 1.19.0-Strawberry

Revision ID: 262bbe790f4c
Revises: 297131e22e28
Create Date: 2018-08-24 11:35:08.577857


These migration were generated with the following procedure:

git checkout 1.19.0-Strawberry
db_reset
mysqldump -hdb --set-gtid-purged=OFF ggrcdev > \
  src/ggrc/migrations/versions/ggrcdev.sql


To test these migrations you can simply compare the migrations from two commits
develop - assuming the commit with this migration is rebased on top of the
  last develop branch.
squash - current commit

git checkout develop
db_reset && mysqldump -uroot -proot ggrcdev > dev.sql
git checkout squash
db_reset && mysqldump -uroot -proot ggrcdev > squash.sql


Note: Some of the squashed migrations can produce different database states
depending on if there was data in the db, when the migration was run. That is
why you should check you generated file and make the minor modifications to it,
so that the end result matches the migrations run before the squash, on an
empty database. If there are any differences in the databases, they should be
handled separately and not in this migration.
