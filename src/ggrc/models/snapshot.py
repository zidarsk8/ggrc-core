  Conceptual model is that we have a parent snapshotable object (e.g. Audit)
  which will not create relationships to objects with automapper at the time of
  creation but will instead create snapshots of those objects based on the
  latest revision of the object at the time of create / update of the object.
  Objects that were supposed to be mapped are called child objects.
