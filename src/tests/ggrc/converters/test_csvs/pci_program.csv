,PCI Program,PCI-DSS 3.1 Security Program (Reference Program),"
The PCI Data Security Standard specifies 12 requirements for compliance, organized into six logically related groups called ""control objectives.""  Each version of PCI DSS has divided these 12 requirements into a number of sub-requirements differently, but the 12 high level requirements have not changed since the inception of the standard.

To comply with the PCI-DSS security standards the following high level tasks must be completed.  Sub-tasks and procedures will be documented within the tool.
Identify and Create company the PCI-DSS Policy and Procedures (PnP)
Identify and Create the necessary company system / security processes
Answer the Self Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ)
Perform gap analysis of the SAQ and PCI-DSS Requirements
Design and Configure Systems to meet PnP requirements
Design or Re-mediate any discrepancies of the SAQ  and PnP 
Perform a Risk Assessment (Annually)
Perform Periodic Tasks as Required
Procure an ASV Vendor

By clearly defining and documenting the services, protocols, and ports that are necessary for business, organizations can ensure that all other services, protocols, and ports are disabled or removed. If insecure services, protocols, or ports are necessary for business, the risk posed by use of these protocols should be clearly understood and accepted by the organization, the use of the protocol should be justified, and the security features that allow these protocols to be used securely should be documented and implemented. If these insecure services, protocols, or ports are not necessary for business, they should be disabled or removed. <br><br> 1.1.7 This review gives the organization an opportunity at least every six months to clean up any unneeded, outdated, or incorrect rules, and ensure that all rule sets allow only authorized services and ports that match the documented business justifications.
