The system will now track each evidence file/ URL as a separate object type which is searchable. For audits, the system will ensure evidence integrity for making a separate Audit specific copy. The object containing the file metadata will be archived along with the audit.

### Offline mode for Import and export (v1.9.0, 04/25/2018)

Now you won’t be stuck waiting on import and export pages. You can go offline after submitting an import. The system will send you a notification via email, once the import or export is completed successfully or some errors occur.

You can now add users to roles directly from info pane to reduce clicks.

### Piper / Git style lite weight versioning on objects like Controls & Risks (v1.2.0, 01/24/2018)

You can propose changes for any control or risk, that you have at least read access to. Just click ‘Propose Changes’ button on object info pane, make changes and save proposal. The system will send a notification via email to object’s admins and primary contacts. Anyone who has edit access to the control or risk, can apply or decline the proposal.

### Versioning functionality for Controls & Risks with ability to roll back to any previous version (v1.2.0, 01/24/2018)

### Labeling assessments (v1.0.0, 01/04/2018)

You can use labels, to easily categorize and search for assessments. You can add labels to an assessment from ‘Add Assessment’, ‘Edit Assessment’ pop-ups, assessment page or import.

### Improvements to surfacing ‘related assessments’ (v0.10.37, 12/20/2017)

The system will consider assessments as related between each other, if they are mapped to the same assessed objects or other mapped versions of it. For example two assessments mapped to control A (or any versions of it) will be considered related. If an assessment is mapped to control B it will be also considered related if control A and B are related.

### Extend assessment assignees rights (v0.10.37, 12/20/2017)

As an assessment assignee, you can now see all regulations and objectives mapped to a control, if such control is mapped to your assessment.

### Commenting functionality (v0.10.37, 12/20/2017)

You can leave comments practically to any objects except workflow related ones. The system will send a notification via email to object’s admins, primary and secondary contacts, if a new comment is added to their object. To turn off such notifications, please uncheck notify checkbox before adding a comment.

### Default sorting by ‘Last Updated Date’ (v0.10.37, 12/20/2017)

The system will sort all objects lists except tasks by last updated date by default, so you can easily find objects that you recently worked with. Tasks will still have default sorting by due date.

3. Search for tasks and select required ones.
4. Choose a state from dropdown.
5. Click ‘Update’ button.

### Import from Google Sheets (v0.10.36, 12/12/2017)

You can import data either from csv file or Google Sheet!

### Linking assessments with other issue tracking systems (v0.10.36, 12/12/2017)

You can link an assessment with other issue tracking/ticketing systems, to receive notifications about its updates. You need to switch on the ticket tracker integration on audit level, and the system will auto-generate a ticket tracking system's ticket for each newly created assessment in scope of this audit. The system will assign such ticket tracking system's ticket to an assessment assignee and updates it each time the assessment state is changed or a new comment is added. You can turn the synchronization off on assessment level or on audit level for all assessments in scope of this audit, if it isn’t required any more.

### Performance improvements

The performance has been improved in the following places in application:

- editing assessments: comments, attributes, states (twice as fast);
- loading of related assessments (twice as fast);
- loading of object counts in the tabs on my work page (5 times faster);
- loading of the graph on audit summary page (now is less than 0.5 sec);
- loading of my tasks count in the header (20 times faster);
- loading a workflow, especially a big one (in about a sec);
- loading objects in tree view (20-50% faster).

Overall these improvements reduced the load on the server and make the entire application more responsive.
