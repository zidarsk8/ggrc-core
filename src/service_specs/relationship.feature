Feature: A Relationship models a relation between two resources. Relationships
  have direction, can be symmetric, and can have their forward and backward
  traversal labeled with a phrase.

  Background:
    Given service description

  Scenario Outline: Asymmetric relations
    Given a new "<type_a>" named "resource_a"
    And "resource_a" is POSTed to its collection
    And a new "<type_b>" named "resource_b"
    And "resource_b" is POSTed to its collection
    And a new "Relationship" named "relationship"
    And "relationship" polymorphic link property "source" is "resource_a"
    And "relationship" polymorphic link property "destination" is "resource_b"
    And "relationship" property "relationship_type_id" is "test_asymmetric"
    And "relationship" is POSTed to its collection
    When GET of the resource "relationship"
    Then the "source" of "relationship" is a link to "resource_a"
    And the "destination" of "relationship" is a link to "resource_b"
    And the "relationship_type_id" property of "relationship" is "test_asymmetric"

  Examples:
      | type_a            | type_b           |
      | Product           | System           |
      | DataAsset         | Process          |

  Scenario Outline: Symmetric relations
    Given a new "<type_a>" named "resource_a"
    And "resource_a" is POSTed to its collection
    And a new "<type_b>" named "resource_b"
    And "resource_b" is POSTed to its collection
    And a new "Relationship" named "relationship"
    And "relationship" polymorphic link property "source" is "resource_a"
    And "relationship" polymorphic link property "destination" is "resource_b"
    And "relationship" property "relationship_type_id" is "test_symmetric"
    And "relationship" is POSTed to its collection
    When GET of the resource "relationship"
    Then the "source" of "relationship" is a link to "resource_a"
    And the "destination" of "relationship" is a link to "resource_b"
    And the "relationship_type_id" property of "relationship" is "test_symmetric"

  Examples:
      | type_a            | type_b           |
      | Product           | System           |
