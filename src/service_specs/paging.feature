Feature: Collections can be paged
  Background:
    Given service description

  Scenario Outline: GET of a collection with __page query parameter returns a paged collection
    Given a new "<resource_type>" named "resource1"
    And a new "<resource_type>" named "resource2"
    And a new "<resource_type>" named "resource3"
    And "resource1" is POSTed to its collection
    And "resource2" is POSTed to its collection
    And "resource3" is POSTed to its collection
    When Querying "<resource_type>" with "__page=1&__page_size=2"
    Then query result selfLink query string is "__page=1&__page_size=2"
    # Remember, they're in descending order by modified_at
    And "resource3" is in query result
    And "resource2" is in query result
    And "resource1" is not in query result
    And query result has a "next" page link
    And query result doesn't have a "prev" page link
    And query result has a "first" page link
    And query result has a "last" page link
    When retrieving query result page "next"
    Then query result selfLink query string is "__page=2&__page_size=2"
    And "resource3" is not in query result
    And "resource2" is not in query result
    And "resource1" is in query result
    And query result has a "prev" page link
    And query result has a "first" page link
    And query result has a "last" page link
    When retrieving query result page "prev"
    Then query result selfLink query string is "__page=1&__page_size=2"
    And "resource3" is in query result
    And "resource2" is in query result
    And "resource1" is not in query result
    And query result doesn't have a "prev" page link
    And query result has a "first" page link
    And query result has a "last" page link
    When retrieving query result page "first"
    Then query result selfLink query string is "__page=1&__page_size=2"
    And "resource3" is in query result
    And "resource2" is in query result
    And "resource1" is not in query result
    And query result doesn't have a "prev" page link
    And query result has a "first" page link
    And query result has a "last" page link
    When retrieving query result page "last"
    Then query result doesn't have a "next" page link
    And query result has a "prev" page link
    And query result has a "first" page link
    And query result has a "last" page link
