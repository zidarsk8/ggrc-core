Feature: Basic RESTful CRUD Support

  Background:
    Given service description

  Scenario Outline: HTTP POST and GET
    Given an example "<resource_type>"
    When the example "<resource_type>" is POSTed to its collection
    Then a 201 status code is received
    And the response has a Location header
    And we receive a valid "<resource_type>" in the entity body
    And the received "<resource_type>" matches the one we posted
