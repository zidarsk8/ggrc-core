""" Basic selenium test runner.
This script is used for running all selenium tests against the server defined
in the configuration yaml file. The script will wait a defined time for the
server to start before running the test. If the server fails to start before
its grace time is up, the script will return with an error code of 3. Error
codes 1 and 2 are reserved by pytest and status 0 is returned only if all the
tests pass.
