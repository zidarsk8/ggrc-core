  """Expand the DDT test cases to a more suitable form.

  This function expands a test case in form of

  Input: (
      [A, B, C],     # Assessments related to each other.
      [(A,B), (A,C)] # Relationships needed for assessments to be related.
  )

  Output: (
    A,               # Tested assessment title
    [B, C]           # Assessments that are relevant to it
    [(A,B), (A,C)]   # Relationships, unchanged.

  ), (
    C,               # Same
    [A, B]
    [(A,B), (A,C)]
  )

  Reasoning:

    The first form is a lot easier to write and read and also less error prone
    when copy pasting to create different test cases. Second form is easier to
    test. Initial test only used the second expanded form but the number of
    test cases rose too fast and it was not clear or readable. The first
    concise form was then introduced, but the problems with it were that same
    test had to check multiple things, meaning either ugly try catch or missing
    bugs until previous tests are fixed.

    Both forms were then joined by using this function at the expense of a bit
    more complexity to understand the code, but with the benefit of easier to
    read and understand tests.

  For easier reading these tests will utilize DDT with complex setup data.
  All data in the test will be referred to by its title and all titles will be
  unique in form of object type + id . For snapshots we will create fake titles
  that will be composed by the keyword snapshot + audit title + object title.
  Since we can not have more than one version of an object snapshot in an
  audit, the given title also addresses a single snapshot revision.

  Relationships will be pairs with
  (source title, destination title)

  All tests will come with the base setup data that will contain:

    "Control 1"
    "Control 2"
    "Requirement 1"
    "Requirement 2"
    "Program 1"
      "Audit 1"
        "Assessment 1" - Type Control
        "Assessment 2" - Type Control
        "Assessment 3" - Type Control
        "Assessment 4" - Type Requirement
        "Assessment 5" - Type Requirement
        "Assessment 6" - Type Standard
        "Snapshot Audit 1 Control 1"
        "Snapshot Audit 1 Control 2"

      "Audit 3"
        "Assessment 9" - Type Control
        "Assessment 10" - Type Requirement
        "Snapshot Audit 3 Control 1"
        "Snapshot Audit 3 Control 2"
        "Snapshot Audit 3 Requirement 1"
        "Snapshot Audit 3 Requirement 2"


  Example of a single test case:

    (

        [
            ("Assessment 1", "Snapshot Audit 1 Control 1"),
            ("Assessment 7", "Snapshot Audit 2 Control 1"),
            ("Assessment 9", "Snapshot Audit 3 Control 1"),
        ]
    )

    In this example we fill first create relationships between assessment 1 and
    snapshot of control one in audit 1, and so on.

    Then we check related assessments for Assessment 1 and assert that related
    assessments contain both Assessment 7 and 9.
    Then we also check the same for Assessment 7 that it contains 1 and 9,
    and similarly for Assessment 9.

    Tests cases will also sometimes just have source and destination swapped
    to ensure that all cases are covered.
