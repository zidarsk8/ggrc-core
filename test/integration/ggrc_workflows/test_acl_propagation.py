    This test just ensures that simultaneous updates to a single workflow work.
    The test checks this by first creating a workflow with first 5 out of 10
    people mapped to that workflow. Then we trigger a bunch of updates to
    workflow people while only using the last 5 people.
    In the end if the procedure does not fail or return an error on any step,
    we should see only a few of the last 5 people and none of the first 5
    people still mapped to the workflow.

    Note: This test does not check for correct setting of acl roles, but only
    that those roles that are set are correctly propagated and that propagation
    does not create any deadlocks.

    Since we have a bug with setting ACLs the result of this test will be that
    same people can have the same role on a workflow multiple times and each of
    those will have correct role propagation.
