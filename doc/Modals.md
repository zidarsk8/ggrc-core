# Modals

## `modal-form.js`:
 - Where the basic low level code for modals exists
 - ModalForm subclasses Form, and it's cloned from Bootstrap for historical reasons. Some of the code may not be used any more.
 - Can generate flash messages that aren't obscured by the backdrop


## `modal-ajax.js`:
 - Spawns modals; named that way for historical reasons (Rails)
 - A big click handler - looking at the `data-toggle` attribute to figure out which modal to open: `data-toggle=modal-ajax`
 - `GGRC.register_global_hook` instantiates modals based on links that have that attribute
 - The biggest one is form - all the edit object modals
 - We apply modals controller in this file as well
 - We are handling modal:success on modal-ajax.js. It's used to navigate to a new URL here.
 - Dirty checks - legacy code, can possibly be removed. `data-dirty` stuff in .mustache marks elements that need reload, but there are only a few left any more
 - Adding a new type of modal - create a new handler
 - [_modal_show](https://github.com/reciprocity/ggrc-core/blob/1e370e487c4377d7e1162dd881954cc26cffe5a9/src/ggrc/assets/javascripts/bootstrap/modal-ajax.js#L355-L423): handles stacking, positioning and prevents double submit and escape
 - [line 451](https://github.com/reciprocity/ggrc-core/blob/1e370e487c4377d7e1162dd881954cc26cffe5a9/src/ggrc/assets/javascripts/bootstrap/modal-ajax.js#L451) extends the Bootstrap model
 - `GGRC.register_global_hook` can be used to add a special modal for a module
 - if you click Delete, a new modal is displayed, [lines 119-151](https://github.com/reciprocity/ggrc-core/blob/1e370e487c4377d7e1162dd881954cc26cffe5a9/src/ggrc/assets/javascripts/bootstrap/modal-ajax.js#L119-L151)

Each modal can have its own controller that handles actions performed by the modals

## `modals_controller.js`:

 - shows the spinner
 - establishes two-way data binding with the form fields; you want to find the state where things stop changing
 - `data-also-set` - TBD
 - 'dfd' = abbreviation for deferred; we need the promise
 - wysiwyg_html extension - we need it to fire triggers when the textarea is updates because we can't read the iframe, it's not in the same domain

 * init()
   - fetch_all fetches the data and template
   - fetch_data a bit complex because we could be TBD
   - _transient property - added to the object instance while the object is open, but removed from the modal once the modal closes
   - run form_preload on the modal (if it exists)
   - apply object params - uses the data-object-params from the link that gets set on the modal. Example: when you create a request for an audit, a hidden field is the audit id. That's how you communicate any information, by adding it to the link that spawns the modal.
   - apply_object_params after all the deferreds - you can pass in arbitrary information into data-param
   - data-object-params gets added to the modal controller as the options object as well
   - calls serialize_form
   - triggers preload

 * serialize_form():
   - gets every element and then calls set_value_for_element()

 * autocomplete
   - extended jQuery UI plugin applied to every input that has data-lookup defined on it
   - `autocomplete_select` is the callback called when the autocomplete value is selected

 * set_value():
   - keeping TBD
   - "it's getting a bit unwieldy, the setvalue function is 100 lines"

## Naming conventions in the forms:
 - name of the input maps to the value of the instance. Most commonly `<input name='url', value='{{url}}' />`
 - if name is name='contact.email' value="{{contact.email}}" - special cases for null in data-lookup onkeyup so that it clears the field

## 'Deferred' modal elements

`mark_for_deletion`/`mark_for_addition` in `cacheable.js` adds/removes items into `_pending_joins`. These pending joins are then handled in `resolve_deferred_bindings`. Removes are easy - it just destroys the mapping. The "add" case is a bit more complex than the "remove" case, as we must check we aren't re-mapping something which is already mapped.

`ggrc_modal_connector` Component used for mapping audits inside modals. Double layer of indirection in this case because context is not yet available when we are creating a new audit. When autocomplete selects a person the app is using `this.scope.changes` to handle the double deferred. Otherwise we just `mark_for_addition` (adding responses). `data-object-source` used for picker additions. `.ui-autocomplete-input` we listen on this for when a new object is created in the mapping modal. That object is created even if we cancel the modal.
