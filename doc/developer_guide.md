# GGRC Developer Guide

This document is a reference for anyone interested in understanding how GGRC is constructed. The goal for this document is to explain how everything works in moderate detail with references to source code which can be used to understand in exact detail how GGRC works.

## Server Side

* * *

### Overview

The interface to the back-end is a REST API. This API is also referred to as a “resource layer”.

Requests come into the REST API. These requests pass through various filters which handle basic concerns such as authentication/authorization/session management (ggrc.login, RBAC), parsing request and formatting responses and others (e.g. query generation).

The server-side REST API has little to no actual logic outside of what’s relevant to saving/creating/deleting/updating models. The server-side is stateless. Complex business logic is encapsulated within the client-side portions of the application.

### Composing the server-side

All of the server-side functionality and behaviors are pulled together in [`src/ggrc/app.py`](/src/ggrc/app.py). This is where all infrastructure is initialized and loaded.

### Resource Layer

#### Overview

The resource layer provides a uniform, external interface to the data model. There isn’t much more to it than that.

The code that builds out the API (what endpoints exist and what HTTP verbs are allowed on each) is in [`src/ggrc/services`](/src/ggrc/services).

See [examples in this GitHub gist](https://gist.github.com/dandv/8794f5add6bcc0e11359).

#### General REST parameters

Every REST API request can take the following parameters:

* `__stubs_only` - return only the `id`, `type`, `href` and `context_id` (A context is a Role-Based Access Control context; every program, audit or workflow has one) fields for each matched object
- `__fields` - specify field names to return

Every REST request (except for search) must pass an `'Accept':'application/json'` header (in order to prevent XSS attacks), or a 406 error will be returned.

**Example** - return the fields `id`, `title` and `description` for two programs:

    GET /api/programs?id__in=2935,2806&__fields=id,title,description

##### REST Response Result Paging

20 records per request are returned by default. This is configurable up to a max of 100 results per page.  See `apply_paging` in [`services/common.py`](/src/ggrc/services/common.py#L803). Request parameters:

- __page_only - only returns paging information, but not resource information
- __page - defaults to 0 if __page_only was specified, and 1 otherwise TBD


**Example** - return the first 20 programs:

    GET /api/programs?id__in=1,2,...&__page=1

#### Search

The server-side logic that handles search is in [`src/ggrc/services/search.py`](/src/ggrc/services/search.py).

Parameters:

- `q` - the query; mandatory, but can be the empty string
- `contact_id` - assume that id as the initiating user. Not a great name for it -- it's the user to whom items should be related. For MyWork, this will be the current user, but on another user X's profile page, it's user X.
- `__permission_type` - default "read" TBD
- `__permission_model` - ? TBD
- `group_by_type` - ? TBD
- `counts_only` - return only the counts of the items found. Used to show the counts in the LHN tree.
- `types` - restrict search to the specified types, e.g. types=Program,Audit
- `extra_params` - unsure. When retrieving counts for workflow states (active, inactive, draft), this parameter is "Workflow_All=Workflow,Workflow_Active=Workflow,Workflow_Draft=Workflow,Workflow_Inactive=Workflow". This may be a special case to handle the extra counts in the LHN Workflows section. TBD.
- `extra_columns` - same as above, this parameter is: "Workflow:status=Active;Workflow_Active:status=Active;Workflow_Inactive:status=Inactive;Workflow_Draft:status=Draft" TBD


#### Routing

Routes to types of resources (audits, programs, etc.), as well as the base routes for the REST API (`/api/` and `/search/`) are determined with the help of a small amount of metadata specified in [`src/ggrc/services/__init__.py`](/src/ggrc/services/__init__.py).

Routes are specified in other places within the Python code via the @app.route annotation.


### Data Layer

#### Data Model

The backend data model (written in Python) lives in [`src/<module>/models`](/src/ggrc/models).

The data model classes and fields are mapped to database tables and columns using SQLAlchemy. These mappings are defined in the model classes themselves. Constraints used for validation and data integrity are described within the model classes as well.

##### Internal vs. External Model

An abstraction exists between the actual data model and the external representation of the data model rendered through the REST interface. This abstraction is necessary because it decouples the external structure of a model from the actual internal structure of the model. This decoupling allows changes to be made to the internal model without violating the contract provided by the REST API. Without this abstraction changes made to the internal model could cause consumers of the REST API to break, and that would be bad.

The "decoupling" is two places:

1. First, the resource-representation is constructed using the Builder class (`ggrc.builder.json`), the behavior of which is currently defined from the model and the `_publish_attrs` and `_update_attrs` attributes.
2. Second, the interaction of resources and the database is defined by the Resource class (`ggrc.services.common.Resource`). The `service(...)` mappings in `ggrc.services.__init__` are defining API endpoints and linking them to Builder classes (autogenerated from the supplied model).

Attributes to be included in the external representation of the model are declared via the `_publish_attrs` attribute of a Python model. Attributes not included in that list will not be included in external representations of the model.

#### Full Text Search

Full text search is enabled for certain models. It is enabled by a class attribute named `_fulltext_attrs` on the model type itself. This essentially declares certain attributes which should be full-text-searchable. The code that actually handles the full-text searching is in [`src/ggrc/fulltext`](/src/ggrc/fulltext).

#### Database Migrations

Migrations are implemented and executed via [alembic](http://alembic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/), augmented to support extension modules in ggrc.migrate.  (The standard `alembic` command will *not* do the right thing.)

Migration scripts are written in Python and live in [`src/<module>/migrations/versions`](/src/ggrc/migrations/versions).

Migrations are executed by running `db_migrate` from the command line.  This effectively runs

    python -c "import ggrc.migrate; ggrc.migrate.upgradeall()"

which iterates through existing modules and runs missing migrations for each.

Migrations can be autogenerated from a fully-migrated environment by first making changes to in-Python model definitions, and then executing (e.g.)

    python -m ggrc.migrate ggrc_workflows revision --autogenerate -m "Add Cycle.is_current"

This will create a new migration file with many unwanted changes (indexes, changes to nullability, etc) due to inconsistencies between database state and model definition.  These should eventually be fixed.  (Indexes should eventually be consistently named, etc.)

### Presentation Layer

(I use the term “presentation” instead of “view” because GGRC has things called “views” and I don’t want to confuse the two.)  TBD: I = who?

#### Templates

Templates are HAML files which define the structural HTML which is basically the scaffolding around which the functionality and features of GGRC are built. Templates don’t define JavaScript logic, client-side models, or “how to render an Audit”. Those types of view logic are defined in `.js` and `.mustache` files.

#### Views

Enough HTML to bootstrap JavaScript. Views are defined in [`src/<module>/views`](/src/ggrc/views). They are Python methods which are mapped to routes (relative URLs).

These views serve two functions:

1. They provide a way to augment the underlying resource paradigm with addition of non-RESTful application logic (Ex. `/admin/reindex`).
2. They provide entry points into the application from which templates can be rendered, which bootstraps the JavaScript which constructs the majority of the actual UI.

#### Encoding and Formatting

Responses returned from the server-side are generated by rendering Python objects into an encoding and format that is understood by the client-side. The standard format is JSON.

The Python code that marshals/unmarshals models to/from JSON is in [`src/ggrc/builder`](/src/ggrc/builder).

##### Import

Data Import is a special case in which requests (as opposed to responses) have to be parsed in order to build models which can then be saved to the underlying database. This is basically just the exact reverse of formatting python objects as JSON, with the caveat that the import format is CSV instead of JSON.

##### Export

Export is similar to default response formatting in the sense that Python models are rendered in a standard format (usually JSON). But in the case of export, the format is CSV.

#### Request Interpretation and Response Construction

The code that interprets requests (to figure out what action to take on the server-side) and constructs responses (applying rendering logic to models) lives in [`src/ggrc/services`](/src/ggrc/services). [`common.py`](/src/ggrc/services/common.py) is particularly important. It implements ModelView & Resource (which extends ModelView).

### Infrastructure and Utilities

#### Persistence

CloudSQL is the underlying database used when running on App Engine.

MySQL is used when running locally (for development).

#### Caching

Memcache is used.

A manifest of the types of objects that should be cached exists in [`src/ggrc/cache/cache.py`](/src/ggrc/cache/cache.py). Types not listed in this file will not be cached by Memcache.

All of the logic related to cache management is in [`src/ggrc/cache`](/src/ggrc/cache).

#### Authentication

The Python code that handles authentication is in [`src/ggrc/login`](/src/ggrc/login). There are currently two handlers, one to enable integration with Google Accounts and another to enable a developer to log in as a specific user by modifying a config file or request header.

#### Data Import

Several types of data can be imported into GGRC by uploading CSV files. The data in those files needs to be converted into python models and validated before being persisted. The code that handles all of this is in [`src/ggrc/converters/`](/src/ggrc/converters). All of the base classes which define common handling logic, as well as code specific to one or more types of model is in that folder.

#### Extensions

Core code which enables the extension mechanism is in [`src/ggrc/extensions.py`](/src/ggrc/extensions.py).

Core code which bootstraps the core GGRC extensions (such as Workflow and GDrive integration) is in [`src/ggrc/ext/__init__.py`](/src/ggrc/ext/__init__.py).

#### Notifications

Code relevant to sending notifications (e.g. email) is in [`src/ggrc/notifications`](/src/ggrc/notifications).

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

RBAC controls the ways in which a user is allowed to interact with GGRC.

Base classes for defining, managing and checking permissions are in [`src/ggrc/rbac`](/src/ggrc/rbac).

#### Cron

Cron jobs are available through App Engine's scheduled tasks mechanism. This facility is configured via [`src/cron.yaml`](/src/cron.yaml).

#### Ad-Hoc Scheduled Tasks in Task Queue

Import, Export, Rebuilding full-text index

### Runtime Configurations

GGRC runs in different environments in two dimensions. The first dimension is App Engine vs. local. The second dimension is development/testing/production.

Which settings are loaded is determined by the environment variable `GGRC_SETTINGS_MODULE`. This variable is expected to contain a set of strings separated by spaces. It should be pretty clear as to how these strings correlate to Python files/modules after looking at the value of that variable.

#### Appengine Runtime vs. Local Runtime

GGRC uses MySQL when running locally. There are other configurations like logging level and authorization which can be configured.

GGRC always uses Google Accounts for authentication when running in App Engine. This is handled by [`src/ggrc/login/appengine.py`](/src/ggrc/login/appengine.py). When running locally, however, different authentication logic is substituted via [`src/ggrc/login/noop.py`](/src/ggrc/login/noop.py). Within this file a developer can hard-code authentication email address and name. There is also logic to allow a developer to pass their email address (allowing them to log in as a specific user) in through a request header (`X-ggrc-user`) which can be manipulated with one of a few Chrome browser plugins. This makes it efficient for a developer to switch among user accounts to test functionality.

Please take a minute to look at [`src/ggrc/settings/app_engine.py`](/src/ggrc/settings/app_engine.py) and [`src/ggrc/settings/default.py`](/src/ggrc/settings/default.py) for more information on settings that can be configured for running in either App Engine or local environments.

#### Development/Testing/Production Runtime

This dimension of runtime configuration allows setting of database credentials, query and application logging and other configurations.

Settings typical for a development environment are in [`src/ggrc/settings/development.py`](/src/ggrc/settings/development.py).

Settings typical for a testing environment are in [`src/ggrc/settings/testing.py`](/src/ggrc/settings/testing.py).

## Client Side

* * *

### Overview

The client-side of GGRC is initially constructed from templates and/or views defined and rendered on the server. The templates and views provide a scaffolding for the UI. Rendering those elements invokes JavaScript code which bootstraps the majority of the client-side of GGRC which is constructed from CanJS Controls and Mustache templates.

Once the Controls are rendered, they take control of generating the remainder of the UI and attaching all relevant logic and user interaction handlers.

There are two main objects that are useful in managing the data model:

* `GGRC`
* `CMS`

For example, `GGRC.page_instance()` returns the current page instance, and `GGRC.page_object` is the object rendered by the current page (e.g. a Program), as it was received from the server (mapped objects are stubs).

`CMS.Models.<MODEL>.cache` stores the loaded objects. For example, `CMS.Models.Program.cache` will have an array of all the loaded programs.

### Client-side File Manifests

JavaScript code as well as all Mustache templates need to be referenced from a manifest file in order for it to be usable in constructing the UI.



These manifest files live in [`src/<module>/assets/assets.yaml`](/src/ggrc/assets/assets.yaml).

### Page Structure

**TODO**: Show and talk about diagram with Title, LHN, Dashboard, Dashboard Widget, Info Widget, TreeView & TreeNode.

![Page structure](res/page_structure.png)

#### View Logic

View logic is defined within the control (as functions on the control itself).

### Widgets (tabs)

Which widgets (or tabs) are shown on the object page is defined in [`business_objects.js`](/src/ggrc/assets/javascripts/apps/business_objects.js). This is where we state which controller should be used for each tab (InfoWidget/TreeView/ListView). TreeViews are used almost everywhere, except on the Admin Dashboard, where we are using ListViews. ListViews have pagination.

Almost every TreeView controller instance has a `parent_instance` variable that can be used to access the parent.
You can't get the parent of an object without a TreeView, because an object can have multiple parents (think of it as a graph). Our TreeViews are trees inside this graph so that's why we can have parent instances in this context.

Filtering a TreeView is done in the TreeFilter, which simply hides the elements from the DOM.

### QuickFormController

This controller derives from the Modals controller in that it takes form input, converts it into properties on model instances, and saves the changes back to the server.  A primary difference in QuickForm is that any update to the instance triggered by QuickForm results in an immediate save().  Also, QuickForm was created with the expectation that the instance already exists on the server; attempts to work with new model instances before first save may result in unexpected behavior.

* How do controllers interact with controls?
* How do controllers interact with the backend?

### Model

View models (defined in JavaScript) are in [`/src/<module>/assets/javascripts/models/`](/src/ggrc/assets/javascripts/models)

The models define:

* how a type of model relates to other types
* behaviors relevant to the model
    * validation rules
    * event listeners
    * default values
    * default view templates
    * initialization logic
* metadata that allows the model to integrate with frameworks and other conventions

#### Stubs vs. Full-form Models

All models have a stub and a full form. All collection attributes of a full form object are stubs.

A stub is a lightweight representation of a full-form model. A stub has references to complex attributes such as collections or other complex models. But those references have to be “traded in” for either stubs or full-form objects in order to walk through the data model. This approach is somewhat analogous to “lazy-loading”.

In contrast, all of the models referenced by a full-form model are not just placeholders, but are true model instances themselves. This approach is more analogous to “eager-loading”.

A stub can be converted into a full-form instance by calling `reify()` on the stub. See also `builder.json`.

#### Lifecycle of a Model

* Primary Operations
  * Saving

  Saving is either done as an update or create operation.  See Updating and Creating below.
  * Updating

  Updating happens when an instance is known to exist on the server (the determinant is whether the id property is set on the instance)
and `save()` is called on the instance. The update is executed with a PUT request to the object endpoint.
  * Creating

  Creating happens when an instance is known not to exist on the server (id property is not set) and `save()` is called on the instance.
The create is executed with a POST request to the collection endpoint.
  * Deleting
  Deleting can only happen on an instance which is known to exist on the server (see Updating above), when `destroy()` is called on a
  model instance.  The delete is executed with a
DELETE request to the object endpoint.  Deletion may execute immediately on the server, in which case the former data of the deleted
object is returned, or deletion may be offloaded to a background task, in which case the returned content from the operation will
reference the background_task object.  On the client side, the deferred returned from `destroy()` will not resolve until the background
task completes.

* Non-lifecycle Model Interactions
 * _transient property

 This property is set on instances during modal operation.  _transient is meant to hold data that is not sent to the server and does
 not need to be kept after the modal completes or is canceled.  This is useful for intermediary values for validation, or calculated
 default values for a property.
 * \_pending_joins() / "deferred bindings"

 Model instances can be joined to other objects as part of their regular update cycles.  After an update completes successfully, any
 deferred binding operations contained in `<instance>._pending_joins` are resolved by adding or removing join objects.  These
 deferred bindings are usually created by using `<instance>.mark_for_addition()` and `<instance>.mark_for_deletion()`
 * other modal-based ops

 The modal includes a connector widget that allows pending join object creation and destruction.  Since the connector widget automates
 the deferred bindings for an instance in deferred mode, no action is taken until the modal is saved.

Are they cached?

* Server-side:
    * Memcache
        * Added to memcache *only* on “collection GET” requests, and expired on any “object PUT” or “object DELETE” requests.
        * [The current locking mechanism (to avoid un-ordered operations from simultaneous requests) is broken and subject to race conditions. In its place, a more standard form of distributed locking should be used, paying attention to the constraints and guarantees made by App Engine's memcache service.]

* Client-side:
    * can.Model.Cacheable
        * Once a model is retrieved to the browser, it is stored in `CMS.Models.<model_name>.cache[<id>]`.  Once present, it is only requested again via the `<instance>.refresh()` method.
        * A model can be conditionally pulled from the server (if it only exists on the client in stub form) by enqueueing it into a
        RefreshQueue, and then subsequently triggering the RefreshQueue.  If an enqueued model has already been synched (i.e. if
        the selfLink property exists on the instance), it will not be re-fetched by the RefreshQueue.

How/when are they validated?

* Server-side:
    * In-database constraints
    * SQLAlchemy validations (using `@validates`)
* Client-side:
    * Defined in class `init()` method on Model classes, and uses Can Validations ([http://canjs.com/docs/can.Map.validations.html](http://canjs.com/docs/can.Map.validations.html))
    * Includes a custom `validateNonBlank()` validation function that trims strings before checking for empty strings.

### View

View templates are implemented all in JavaScript with the help of Mustache.

#### Standard view templates

Several standard view fragments are defined for each type of entity within GGRC. Additional fragments can be created and utilized as needed. But these templates are the main templates from which the majority of the UI is created.

* `tree.mustache` - Defines the content of the trees for specified object types. This template reflects Tier 1 and Tier 2 information (Tier 2 being a more detailed set of information relevant to an object).  Specified as the `show_view` option in each TreeView.
* `tree_footer.mustache` - If present, defines the content of the last row of a given tree.  Usually contains a “Add Object” or “+ Object” link which invokes a mapping or creation modal.  Specified as the `footer_view` option in each TreeView.
* `info.mustache` - Defines the “Info” widget on each object’s page.  Defined per-widget in GGRC.Controllers.InfoWidget as the `widget_view` option, and specified using `GGRC.WidgetList` definitions.
* `extended_info.mustache` - Defines the content of an object’s tooltip/popover in the LHN lists.  Specified as the `tooltip_view` parameter when rendering [`src/ggrc/assets/mustache/dashboard/lhn.mustache`](/src/ggrc/assets/mustache/dashboard/lhn.mustache).
* `modal_content.mustache` - Defines the view for modal “create” or “edit” form functionality.  For most objects, this path is automatically generated using the `data-template` or `data-object-plural` attributes of the invoking element (see [`bootstrap/modal-ajax.js`](/src/ggrc/assets/javascripts/bootstrap/modal-ajax.js).


#### Where to find view templates

The view files are in the following folder within a module:

    /src/<module>/assets/mustache/

For example, the `ggrc_workflow` views are in the following folder:

    /src/ggrc_workflows/assets/mustache/

#### View Helpers

View helpers are defined using the Mustache [helper mechanism provided by CanJS](http://canjs.com/docs/can.mustache.Helpers.html).  Core helpers are specified in [`src/ggrc/assets/javascripts/mustache_helpers.js`](/src/ggrc/assets/javascripts/mustache_helper.js), and extension helpers should be specified in a file named similar to `src/<module_name>/assets/javascripts/<class_name>_mustache_helpers.js`.

### Extensions

An extension is a bundle of code and assets packaged into a folder hierarchy similar to ggrc-core.  Extensions have at minimum a
startup script at &lt;extension-folder&gt;/\_\_init\_\_.py and a settings file in &lt;extension-folder&gt;/settings

The extensions which are used in any GGRC instance are determined by the GGRC\_SETTINGS\_MODULE shell variable. To add an extension to
a GGRC deployment, append a space separator and the Python path to the settings file (e.g.
" ggrc\_some\_extension.settings.development") to this shell variable, and restart or redeploy the GGRC server.

The minimum that the extension settings file must contain is `EXTENSIONS = ['<name_of_extension>']`.  Additionally, global settings
can be provided; any variable set at the top level in this file will be added to the `ggrc.settings` object and later accessible
through `from ggrc import settings`.  Setting `exports =` to an array of key names in the extension settings file will make those keys
and their values available to the client side through the `GGRC.config` object.

The minimum that \_\_init\_\_.py must contain is:

```python
from flask import Blueprint

blueprint = Blueprint(
    '<name_of_extension>',
    __name__,
    template_folder='templates',
    static_folder='static',
    static_url_path='/static/<name_of_extension>',
    )
```

This will set up an extension to be recognized by Flask.

Asset hierarchies in extensions should follow the ggrc-core model: assets.yaml should define the bundles for dasboard-js,
dashboard-templates, and dashboard-js-specs; The folder naming convension for these bundles (`assets/javascripts`, `assets/mustache`,
and `assets/js_specs`, respectively) should be followed for each extension.  An important caveat is that the assets bundler can only
bundle one asset with a given path over all base folders, so you should avoid re-using paths known to exist in ggrc-core or other
extenions (e.g. "mustache_helper.js" and "models/mixins.js" already exist in ggrc-core, so don't name your files the same as these).

DB migrations should be set up in `migrations/versions` as in ggrc-core.  Once the extension is created and the settings path added to
GGRC\_SETTINGS\_MODULE, db_migrate should pick up any migrations automatically.  To completely undo the migrations from an extension
(in order to remove it without possible database breakage), use the command `db_downgrade <name_of_extension> -1`

#### Extension contributions

* Models

 Define models in your `<extension_name>/models/` folder, and use the same patterns for implementing them as ggrc-core does (derive from ggrc.db.Model, use provided mixins, make association proxy tables and models, etc.).  Be sure to import all files from models
 as part of the extension's \_\_init\_\_.py

* Services

 Services provide the CRUD object endpoints over REST to allow instaces of your extension models.  ggrc-core provides a contributions
 mechanism for defining more services from your extension at startup time.  The services contribution is done as such:

 ```python
 from . import models
 from ggrc.services.registry import service

 def contributed_services():
  return [
    service(m.__table__.name, m)
    for m in models.__dict__.values()
    if isinstance(m, type)
    and issubclass(m, db.Model)
    ]
 ```

* Views
 * Any special templates should be placed under &lt;extension\_module\_name&gt;/templates/ and called as normal.
 * To set up an object page for one of the contributed model classes, declare a function similar to this (this function will work as long as your module hierarchy is flat with all models at the first level and you want all of your objects to have pages):

 ```python
 from ggrc.views.registry import object_view
 from . import models
 from ggrc import db

 def contributed\_object\_views():

* Roles
 * ROLE_CONTRIBUTIONS: at module level, subclass `RoleContributions`, overriding `contributions`, and set this property to an instance of the subclass.
 * ROLE_DECLARATIONS: at module level, subclass `RoleDeclarations`, overriding `roles()`, and set this property to an instance of the subclass.
 * ROLE_IMPLICATIONS: at module level, subclass `DeclarativeRoleImplications`, overriding `implications`, and set this property to an instance of the subclass.

### Modals

The core logic and functionality related to modals is defined in the following files:

- [`ggrc/assets/javascripts/bootstrap/modal-ajax.js`](/src/ggrc/assets/javascripts/bootstrap/modal-ajax.js)
- [`ggrc/assets/javascripts/bootstrap/modal-form.js`](/src/ggrc/assets/javascripts/bootstrap/modal-form.js)
- [`ggrc/assets/javascripts/controllers/modals_controller.js`](/src/ggrc/assets/javascripts/controllers/modals_controller.js)

The view for a modal is defined in `/src/<module>/assets/mustache/<class_name>/modal_content.mustache`.

More about modals in [modals.md](modals.md).

### Events

Client-side event firing/handling is handled through CanJS, which is primarily based on jQuery event handling.

### Program Flow

Most client-side logic is implemented in Controls. Much of this logic is implemented using asynchronous callbacks via [can.Deferred](http://canjs.com/docs/can.Deferred.html).

### Error Handling

Most errors are reported to the system with a `window.onerror` handler that generates flash messages at the top of the page and reports
the exception back to Tracker.  For maximum coverage, the script that defines this handler is inlined into base.haml.

AJAX failures that happen while a modal is active are reported back to a flash handler at the modal level (so that the flash messages
are not covered by modals or overlays).

Because the error handler at the window level handles most of our needs, try/catch blocks are rare in GGRC.  However, it is worth
noting that errors in Deferred callbacks may not fire the onerror handler, *and* "break the chain" inasmuch as the state of the
deferred never changes from "pending" after that, and other deferreds waiting for the result of that deferred will never run.  This
is a failure of the jQuery Deferred object to sensibly handle uncaught errors (they should reject the deferred instead). In the case
where it's possible that a callback will throw an error, it is recommended to wrap the content of the callback in `try/catch` and
return a rejected deferred when an error happens.

### Mappings

Mappings are best thought of as **links**. (“Mapping” [often means](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mapping) a 1-to-1 correspondence, and for historical reasons is the term adopted by GGRC users; but in actuality; we have links between objects - e.g. a Directive is **linked** to a Section, or a Programs **references** zero or more Controls.) “Mappings” are a way to relate any model instance to another model instance in a way that is flexible, and doesn't require modifying the relational structure in the underlying data store used for persistence (database).  They're essentially just an abstraction over our database, so that you don't have to care about which tables the relationships are stored in.

Mappings essentially turn the entire system into a [property graph](https://github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/wiki/Defining-a-Property-Graph).

Mappings are defined in [`/src/ggrc/assets/javascripts/models/mappings.js`](/src/ggrc/assets/javascripts/models/mappings.js).

We don't have a function that gets all the objects mapped to a given object.
You can get the mappings of an instance by calling `instance.get_mappings('_mapping_')` if the mappings are already loaded, or by calling `instance.get_binding('_mapping_').refresh_list()` if they are not.

#### Types of Mappings

There are 8 types of mappings. The types of mappings are defined with Mappers. Mappers are defined in [`/src/ggrc/assets/javascripts/models/mappers.js`](/src/ggrc/assets/javascripts/models/mappers.js)

Each type of mapping is defined below:

* **Proxy**: A proxy mapping is a relationship where one model references another through another “join” or “proxy” model.  E.g., Programs reference Controls via the ProgramControl join/proxy model.  The Proxy mapping specifies the attributes and models involved in the relationship, e.g.:

* **Direct**: A direct mapping is a relationship where one model directly references another model.  E.g., Sections contain a `directive` attribute, so Section has a Direct mapping to Directive.

* **Indirect**: An indirect mapping is the reverse of `Direct`, but the implementation is inconsistent with the rest of the mappers.

* **Search**: A search mapping is a relationship where results are produced by a function returning a deferred. This mapping is f
foremost used by the Advanced Search feature and for getting owned objects for a Person, but other uses are also possible.  Note that the search function is run at attach time and also when a new object of any type is created, so it is recommended to use this mapper
sparingly in the system if it makes a number of large AJAX calls.

* **Multi**: Constructs a mapping which is the union of zero or more other mappings.  Specifically, the set of `result.instance` values is the union of `result.instance` from the contributing mappings.

* **TypeFilter**: A TypeFiltered mapping takes the result of another mapping and returns only the results which are instances of a
specified type.  This is useful for filtering polymorphic proxies.

* **CustomFilter**: A custom filtered mapping runs a filter function on every result coming from a source mapping and returns all
results where the function returns either a truthy value or a deferred that resolves to a truthy value.  The filter function is re-run
whenever an instance in the source mapping changes, and adds and removes a mapping to that instance accordingly.

* **Cross**: Similar to Proxy mapping, but joins across other mappings.  For example, the result of `m = Cross("a", "b")` would be the union of the “b” mappings for every instance in the root object’s “a” result set.



## Testing

* * *

GGRC testing consists of 4 components:

### Manual tests

Several day's worth of tests defined in spreadsheets and executed primarily by Kostya.  These are the primary source of regression stories and bug-finding.

### Automated Browser Tests

Implemented using WebDriver for Python and executed either locally or on the CI server.

### Python Unit Tests

These are currently defined in [`src/ggrc/tests`](/src/ggrc/tests), but as of 2014/07/07 are in poor state due to non-upkeep.  Mostly, these test import/export.

### Python "behave" tests, using the `behave` Python module

These are defined using the Gherkin language, in `src/service_specs/*.feature` and `src/<module>/service_specs/*.feature`, and are the core set of service-side/API tests.
