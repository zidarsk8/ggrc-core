# How to Write a Git Commit Message

This is all shamelessly based on
[chris.beams.io](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line (spoken or written as if giving
  a command or instruction)
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

A properly formed git commit subject line should always be able to complete the
following sentence:

**If applied, this commit will _your subject line here_**

Good: If applied, this commit will **refactor subsystem X for readability**

Bad: If applied, this commit will **fixes for broken stuff**

Commit message should be summary line and description of what you have done in
the imperative mode, that is as if you were commanding someone. Write "fix",
"add", "change" instead of "fixed", "added", "changed".

Examples:

#### Bad
1. Fixed bug with {something}.
2. changing behavior of {something}
3. more fixes for broken stuff
4. sweet new API methods
5. Removing stuff

#### Good
1. Fix bug when {something_else} doesn't exist
2. Change behavior of {something} to do {behavior_x}
3. [don't do this, fix one specific thing in a commit]
4. Add {method_a}, {method_b} and {method_c} methods to API
5. Remove unused {method_a}, {method_b}...

# Before Issuing a New Pull Request

While every pull request is automatically checked on a continuous integration
server, it is better to catch issues early, resulting in less broken builds and
reduced time before the PR is merged. You should thus run a few tests locally
before submitting the PR for a review.

It is OK to defer some of the checks if they take too much time to be feasible
to run them locally (as a rule of thumb: 10+ minutes). These checks can be
deferred until the CI server runs them.

You are still encouraged to run them yourself, though, if you can afford the
waiting, e.g. just before taking a longer break (lunch, meeting...).


### Checking the front-end code

##### Code style checks

The [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) tool is used for checking the Javascript code
quality. You must assure that your pull request does not increase the number of
ESLint issues found.

To check the code quality of a particular file, run the following in the
development container's console:
```console
eslint path/to/some/file.js
```
You will see a list of all issues found and the corresponding line numbers.
Sample output:

```console
...
105:23  error    Strings must use singlequote                         quotes
112:7   warning  Identifier name 'fooBaa...ar' is too long. (> 25)    id-length
112:48  error    Missing space before function parentheses            space-before-function-paren
114:23  error    Strings must use singlequote                         quotes
120:3   error    Split 'var' declarations into multiple statements    one-var
...

✖ 74 problems (73 errors, 1 warning)
```

You need to resolve at least the issues in the line(s) you have modified, but
it is strongly encouraged to also improve _all_ the lines in every
function/method you have touched.

When you submit a new pull request, a script will check how many Javascript
code issues there are on the PR branch, and how many there were at the point
when the PR branch was forked from the target branch (i.e. the _merge base_).
The target branch is the one the PR will be sent to, usually `develop`.

If the issue count difference is positive, the check will fail, because new
code should not increase the number of Javascript issues. To avoid that and
preemptively perform the same check locally, do the following:

* Make sure that you are currently on a branch containing the changes that will
  be submitted with the pull request (the PR branch), and that you have these
  changes committed,
* Make sure that you don't have any pending local file modifications. Use
  `git stash` if necessary,
* Run the following in the development container's console:

  ```console
  check_eslint_diff
  ```

If the PR branch was forked from (and will be sent to) a branch other than
`develop`, you should specify this with a `-t` (or `--merge-target`) option
when running the script:

```console
check_eslint_diff -t release/foo-0.0.1
```

##### Running the tests

Run the following in the development container's console:
```console
run_karma
```

When the Karma server (a Javascript test runner) starts, open
`http://localhost:9876/` in a browser. The browser will connect to the Karma
server and run all Javascript unit tests. The outcome of the tests will be
printed to the console, make sure they all pass.

_NOTE: The officially supported browser by the application is Chrome. It is thus
strongly recommended that you, too, use Chrome for running the tests locally._


### Checking the back-end code

##### Code style checks

At the moment, no automatic Python coding style checks are performed - yet. You
should nevertheless make your best effort to write
[PEP8 compliant](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) code to make it
more future compatible for when such automatic checks are introduced and
enforced.

##### Running the tests

To run the Python unit and integration tests, run the following in the
development container's console:
```console
run_pytests
```

_NOTE: Python integration tests take a while to run, around 20 minutes (give or
take) on a decent laptop._

### End-to-end tests

To run the full-fledged end-to-end system tests, go to the project root
directory **on the host machine** and run the following from its console:

```console
./bin/jenkins/run_selenium
```

Please keep in mind that, for various technical reasons, Selenium tests
**should not** be run from inside a container!

_NOTE: These tests only work with Docker-based development environments, since
they require Docker prerequisites to be installed on the host machine. Vagrant
is not supported._

# Pull Request Titles

For pull request titles we should use the same rules as for the subject line of
a commit, but we need to prefix the issue id (or QUICK-FIX or DOCS if there is
no issue id).

Examples:

```
CORE-9999 Fix performance issues on bulk operations
QUICK-FIX Prevent breaking tasks into multiple lines
DOCS Add section that explains client side mappings
```
